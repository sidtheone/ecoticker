# Epic 3 Retrospective: Impact Sprint

**Date:** 2026-02-17
**Facilitator:** Bob (Scrum Master)
**Participants:** Alice (PO), Bob (SM), Charlie (Senior Dev), Dana (QA), Elena (Junior Dev), Sidhartharora (Project Lead)

## Epic Summary

- **Epic:** 3 — Impact Sprint
- **Goal:** Ship three highest-impact features: dynamic headline (retention), social sharing (acquisition), article count indicator (credibility)
- **Stories Completed:** 3/3 (100%)
- **All stories Size S**
- **Tests:** 258 → 266 (+8 new)
- **Blockers:** 0
- **Production Incidents:** 0
- **Technical Debt Items:** 1 (minor — OG description uses impactSummary instead of overallSummary)

## Successes

- 100% story completion, zero blockers, clean sprint
- Server/client split pattern for metadata (layout.tsx + "use client" page.tsx) — canonical Next.js pattern, worked perfectly
- Proxy-based test mock improvement emerged from code review — more resilient than brittle chain mocking
- Code review cycle working well — caught 6 real issues on Story 3-2, all fixed in minutes
- Small story sizing = fast delivery + high confidence
- Simplicity was the result of good planning, not luck

## Challenges

- Defensive coding gaps (clipboard error handling, setTimeout cleanup) caught only in code review, not during implementation
- Pre-BMM stories (3-1, 3-3) have no documentation trail — no story files, no dev notes
- Epic-to-story AC drift: epic said `overallSummary`, story AC said `impactSummary` for OG description
- No failure-path tests for async operations until review flagged it

## Key Insights

1. Simplicity was the result of good planning — small, well-scoped stories ship fast
2. Code review is the safety net, but raise the floor with explicit error handling in Dev Notes
3. `validate-create-story` should be mandatory before dev, not optional
4. Epic-to-story spec drift is preventable with validation

## Previous Retrospective

First retrospective — no previous retro exists for Epic 1 or 2.

## Action Items

### Process Improvements

1. **Run `validate-create-story` before every `dev-story`**
   - Owner: Bob (SM)
   - Success criteria: No story enters dev without validation pass

2. **Add failure-path test requirement for async operations**
   - Owner: Dana (QA)
   - Success criteria: Every story with `await` has rejection/error tests

3. **Include "Error Handling & Edge Cases" in story Dev Notes**
   - Owner: Bob (SM)
   - Success criteria: Dev Notes section explicitly lists error scenarios

### Documentation

4. **Replace `og-default.png` with designer-created branded image**
   - Owner: Sidhartharora (Project Lead)
   - Success criteria: Professional OG image before marketing push

### Team Agreements

- Code review is mandatory — no story goes to "done" without it
- Small stories preferred — break Medium+ into multiple Smalls when possible
- Dev Notes drive implementation — if it's not in Dev Notes, it gets missed

## Epic 4 Preparation

**STATUS: BLOCKED — Pending re-analysis**

New feedback received that requires Epic 4 stories and possibly sources to be redone.

- [ ] Deploy Epic 3 to production and verify (especially OG meta/social previews)
- [ ] Run Analyst (Mary) to re-examine Epic 4 requirements based on new feedback
- [ ] Update `epic-4.md` with revised stories and sources
- [ ] Run `create-story` for new stories
- [ ] Run `validate-create-story` before dev begins

### Critical Path

1. **Production testing of Epic 3** — verify OG tags, social previews, dynamic headline live
   - Owner: Sidhartharora
   - Must complete before: Epic 4 dev work

2. **Epic 4 re-planning with Analyst**
   - Owner: Sidhartharora
   - Must complete before: any Epic 4 dev work

## Significant Discoveries

Epic 4's current plan (RSS fallback from EPA/NOAA/UN feeds) may be based on outdated assumptions. User received external feedback requiring story and source revision. Epic 4 should NOT begin until Analyst review is complete and stories are validated.

## Next Epic Preview

- **Epic 4: Operational Resilience** — eliminate single point of failure on news sources
- 2 stories planned (may change after re-analysis)
- No direct dependencies on Epic 3
- Major context switch: frontend (Epic 3) → backend/pipeline (Epic 4)
- `sourceType` column exists in schema but unused — ready for Epic 4
