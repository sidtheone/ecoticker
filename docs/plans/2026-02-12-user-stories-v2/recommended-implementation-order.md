# Recommended Implementation Order

## Phase 1: Foundation
**US-1.1** — Scoring architecture (L)
Everything else either depends on this or is enhanced by it. After this ships, the data is correct.

## Phase 2: Make It Visible
**US-1.2** (M), **US-1.5** (S), **US-2.2** (M), **US-11.1** (S)
Sub-score breakdown with reasoning, category labels on cards, scoring methodology page, GDPR data policy page. After this ships, users can see AND understand the new architecture — and we're legally compliant for EU launch.

## Phase 3: Depth
**US-1.3** (M), **US-1.4** (S), **US-3.1** (S), **US-2.1** (S)
Sub-score history trends, category filters, dynamic headline, article count indicator. Deeper engagement features.

## Phase 4: Operational Resilience
**US-5.1** (M), **US-5.2** (S)
Backup news source, source attribution. US-9.1 eliminated (Railway managed backups). The system becomes reliable.

## Phase 5: Admin & Measurement
**US-4.1** (M), **US-4.2** (S), **US-4.3** (S), **US-8.1** (S), **US-8.2** (M)
Keyword management, analytics. We can now grow topic coverage and measure usage.

## Phase 6: Growth & Feedback Loop
**US-6.1** (S), **US-6.2** (M), **US-6.3** (M), **US-10.1** (S), **US-10.2** (S)
Sharing, embedding, social cards, user feedback. The product escapes the app and improves through usage.

**Next step:** Review each story. Approve, modify, or reject. Then begin implementation with US-1.1.
