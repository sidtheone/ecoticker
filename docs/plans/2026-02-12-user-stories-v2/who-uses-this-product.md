# Who Uses This Product?

Before any story makes sense, we need to know who we're building for. The business panel identified four personas. Every story below is written for one of them.

## Persona 1: The Concerned Citizen ("Casey")
Casey heard about wildfires on the news and wants to know: "How bad is it, really?" They're not an expert. They want a simple, trustworthy answer. They'll visit once from a social media link, maybe bookmark the page, probably never return unless we give them a reason to.

**Casey's current experience:** Lands on dashboard. Sees "California Wildfire Season: 67" with an orange badge. Has no idea what 67 means. No explanation anywhere. Leaves confused. We lost them.

## Persona 2: The Climate-Beat Journalist ("Jordan")
Jordan covers environmental issues professionally. They need a daily signal: what's escalating, what's de-escalating, what deserves a story? They currently build this picture manually from dozens of sources — Google Alerts, agency press releases, Twitter, other journalists' tips.

**Jordan's current experience:** Opens EcoTicker, sees "EcoTicker — Environmental news impact tracker." Scans the grid. Notices "Arctic Sea Ice" went up 6 points. But WHY? Clicks through. Sees a sparkline and some articles. No reasoning, no dimension breakdown. Can't cite "EcoTicker says..." because the methodology is opaque. Closes tab, goes back to manual methods.

## Persona 3: The Sustainability Officer ("Morgan")
Morgan works at a mid-size company and needs environmental severity data for quarterly reports. Can't afford Bloomberg ESG ($25K/year). Needs rough severity signals with enough credibility to put in a slide deck.

**Morgan's current experience:** Visits monthly. Needs to screenshot the sparkline and manually type "Score increased from 55 to 62." No export, no embeddable chart, no methodology page to link as a source. The data is there but can't be used professionally.

## Persona 4: The Operator ("Us")
We run the system. We need it to work reliably, need to know when scores are wrong, need to understand if anyone uses it.

**Our current experience:** We deploy and hope. No analytics, no feedback loop, no anomaly alerts. If OpenRouter swaps the underlying model and all scores shift by 20 points, we'd never know.
